# Push to GitHub - Quick Commands

## âœ… All Files Are Ready!

Your project has been committed locally. Now push to GitHub:

## Option 1: Using HTTPS (Recommended)

```bash
cd /Users/abhay.kumar/Desktop/project

# Set remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/code-abhay/contentcon.git

# Push
git push -u origin main
```

**Note**: GitHub will prompt for authentication. You can:
- Use a Personal Access Token (recommended)
- Or use GitHub CLI: `gh auth login`

## Option 2: Using GitHub CLI

If you have GitHub CLI installed:

```bash
cd /Users/abhay.kumar/Desktop/project
gh repo create code-abhay/contentcon --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

## Option 3: Create Repo on GitHub First

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `contentcon`
3. Set to **Public** (or Private if preferred)
4. **Don't** initialize with README
5. Click "Create repository"
6. Then run:

```bash
cd /Users/abhay.kumar/Desktop/project
git remote add origin https://github.com/code-abhay/contentcon.git
git push -u origin main
```

## ðŸ”— After Push - Use This Repo Link

Once pushed successfully, use this repository link in Contentstack Launch:

```
https://github.com/code-abhay/contentcon
```

Or just:
```
code-abhay/contentcon
```

## âœ… What's Already Done

- âœ… Git repository initialized
- âœ… All files committed (39 files)
- âœ… Main branch created
- âœ… Ready to push!

Just need to authenticate and push! ðŸš€
