# 🚀 Final Step: Push to GitHub

## ✅ Status

Your project is fully committed and ready! All 40 files are committed locally.

## 📤 Push Command

**Just run this one command:**

```bash
cd /Users/abhay.kumar/Desktop/project
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔐 If You Need Authentication

GitHub will ask for credentials. Use one of these methods:

### Option 1: Personal Access Token (Recommended)

1. Create token: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Select scopes: `repo` (full control)
4. Copy the token
5. When git asks for password, paste the **token** (not your GitHub password)

### Option 2: GitHub Desktop

1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. File → Add Local Repository
3. Select: `/Users/abhay.kumar/Desktop/project`
4. Click "Publish repository"

### Option 3: SSH (If you have SSH key set up)

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:code-abhay/contentcon.git
git push -u origin main
```

## ✅ After Successful Push

Once pushed, your repository will be at:

```
https://github.com/code-abhay/contentcon
```

## 🎯 Use This in Contentstack Launch

In Launch, when connecting GitHub, use:

- **Repository**: `code-abhay/contentcon`
- **OR Full URL**: `https://github.com/code-abhay/contentcon`

That's it! The repo will be ready for Launch deployment! 🚀
